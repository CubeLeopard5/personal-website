                <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) / Tribunal Arbitral du Sport (TAS) is an independent international organization established in 1984 that resolves sports-related disputes through arbitration and mediation. Headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, it serves as the supreme court for international sports.</p>
